The project was initiated based on two of my favorite quotes:

> “If you want to master something, teach it. The more you teach, the better you learn. Teaching is a powerful tool to learning.” ― [Richard Phillips Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman)

> “All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow.” ― [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/), Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones
